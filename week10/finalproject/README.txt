# Selenium-Final-Project

## Intro

We have been learning in the QA bootcamp for 2 months and now it's time to put it all together! In this project, we will write a test plan, 
develop automation infrastructure, and implement all kinds of tests. We will use best practices of test automation and the tools we learned. We will be testing the following site:

## Guidelines

### UI

* Actions under tests are performed in the UI.
* Validations are done in the UI.

### AAA

* Tests built in Arrange, Act, Assert structure.

### Test Isolation (Independence)

* All tests should be independent and not affect or be affected by other tests.

### Assertions

* Use the most accurate assertions.

### Logger

* Test results are presented in the logger file.

### Infrastructure

* Code should be structured in layers (infra, logic, tests).
* Use Page Object Model (POM).

### GIT

* Use pull requests and have code reviews.
* Use informative commit messages.

### Stability

* Make sure tests pass consistently!
* Tests may fail if there are actual bugs in the system.
